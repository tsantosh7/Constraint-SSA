function [kaic,kmdl,aic,mdl]=itc(V,n); 
% Syntax: [kaic,kmdl,aic,mdl]=itc(V,n); 
% Compute signal/noise separation using information-theoretic 
% criteria. Two estimates are returned: the Akaike  
% information-theoretic criterion (AIC), and the minimum 
% description length (MDL). The order for which AIC or MDL is 
% minimum gives the number of significant components in the  
% signal. The two methods often give considerably different  
% results: AIC usually performs better than MDL in low SNR 
% situations, but MDL is a consistent estimator, and thus  
% performs better in large-sample situations. These estimators 
% are based on a white-noise hypothesis - and are thus 
% of limited usefulness.

% Input:   V: an eigenspectrum (sorted in decreasing order) 
%          n: the number of samples used to compute V. 
% Outputs: kaic: the order for which AIC is minimum; 
%          kmdl: the order for which MDL is minimum; 
%          aic: vector containing AIC estimates; 
%          mdl: vector containing MDL estimates.
