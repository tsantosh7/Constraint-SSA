function [f,g,v]=ssaconf(V,N) 
% Calculates various heuristic confidence limits for SSA. 
% Syntax: [f,g,v]=ssaconf(V,N); 
% Given a singular value vector V and the number of points 
% in the original series N, ssaconf returns vectors containing 
% the 95% confidence interval. These are calculated according  
% to the variance formulas of: 
%     f: Fraedrich 1986 
%     g: Ghil and Mo 1991a 
%     v: Vautard, Yiou, and Ghil 1992. 
% All estimates are for the 95% confidence level. 
% These simple estimates may be adequate for some purposes, 
% but none of them adequately consider the autocorrelation  
% of the time series. The estimates g and v are very similar 
% for N>>M. They are usually fairly conservative, as they 
% correspond to a decorrelation time of M. The Fraedrich 
% estimate is valid only for uncorrelated data, so it tends   
% to give error estimates which are too small.
